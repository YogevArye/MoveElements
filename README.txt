A function that moves the initial segment of consecutive array elements to the end of the array. 
The elements that follow the segment should all be moved to the left.

For example: Given the array 3, 7, 2, 8, 5, 9, 1, 4:
The result of moving the initial segment that includes 3 elements (i.e., [3, 7, 2]) is 8, 5, 9, 1, 4, 3, 7, 2.
